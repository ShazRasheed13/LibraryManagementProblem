# LibraryManagementProblem
A practice question for testing and refactoring

# Problem Statement
You're working on a legacy library system that manages books and their loan status. Each book has:

Title
Status (Available, Borrowed, Overdue, In Repair)
Days borrowed (if applicable)
Condition rating (1-5, where 5 is excellent)

Business Rules:

1. Books that are borrowed for more than 14 days become "Overdue"
2. Each time a book is returned, its condition rating decreases by 1
3. If a book's condition rating drops to 1, it must go to "In Repair" status
4. Books in "In Repair" status get their condition improved by 2 points after repair
5. Condition rating can never exceed 5 or go below 1
6. "In Repair" books take 5 days to repair
7. Books cannot be borrowed if they are "Overdue" or "In Repair"
